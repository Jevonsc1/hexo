1. Soldering iron(电烙铁)
---

> Middle-of-the-line is best here. Cheap soldering irons die fast, but a mid-range iron like the Weller WLC-100 works great for small electronic work. Avoid the Cold Solder irons. They solder by creating a spark, and that sparkcan damage static-sensitive parts like microcontrollers. 
电线不长不短的电烙铁是最好用的。对于太便宜的电烙铁会很容易坏，而一些中等价格的电烙铁，例如Weller WLC-100 就很适合做小电工。一定要避免冷焊（即不用焊料），不然会产生损害元件的火花。
<br/><br/>
2. Solder（焊料）
---> 21-23 AWG solder is best. Get lead-free(无铅) solder if you can; it’s healthier for you.<br/><br/>3. Desoldering pump（吸锡器）
---> This helps when you mess up while soldering. 
<br/><br/>4. Wire stripper, Diagonal cutter, Needle-nose pliers(削线器，对角切割器，尖咀钳）
--- > Avoid the 3-in-1 versionsof these tools. They’ll only make you grumpy. These three tools are essential for working with wire, and you don’t need expensive ones to have good ones.
千万不要买3合一的类型，因为这只会让你感到脾气暴躁，这些工具能很好应付线材工作，你不需要买很贵的，够用就行。
<br/><br/>5. Mini-screwdriver(小型螺丝刀)
--- > Get one with both Phillips and slotted heads. You’ll use it all the time.
 十字一字螺丝刀各一个，你会常常用到它们的。
 <br/><br/>
6. Safety goggles(保护眼罩)
--- > Always a good idea when soldering, drilling, or other tasks.
  焊接，钻东西是最好戴上。
 <br/><br/> 
7. Helping hands(支架)
--- > These make soldering much easier. 
 
可以让焊接更简单
 <br/><br/>
8. Multimeter(万用表)
---
 >You don’t need an expensive one. As long as it measures voltage, resistance, amperage, and continuity, it’ll do the job. 
 
 不需要很贵，能量电压，电阻，电流就行
 
<br/><br/>9. Oscilloscope(示波器)---
> Professional oscilloscopes are expensive, but the DSO Nano isonly about $100 and a valuable aid when working on electronics. 
专业的示波器会很贵，但DSO Nano这款只需100美元。

<br/><br/>10. 9–12V DC power supply---
> You’ll use this all the time, and you’ve probably got a spare from some dead electronic device. Make sure you know the polarity of the plug so you don’t reverse polarity ona component and blow it up! Most ofthe devices shown in this book have a DC power jack that accepts a 2.1mm inner diameter/5.5mm outer diameter plug, so look for an adapter with the same dimensions.
<br/><br/>11. Power connector, 2.1mm inside diameter/5.5mm outside diameter(电源连接线，内径2.1mm,外径5.5mm)
--- > You’ll need this to connect your microcon- troller module or breadboard to a DC power supply. This size connector is the most common for the power supplies that will work with the circuits you’ll be building here.
 你将会需要这个物件去将微控制器模块或面包板和电源连接起来。这是这里最常用的尺寸的连接器。
 
<br/><br/>12. 9V Battery snap adapter and 9V battery
---> When you want to run a project off battery power, these adapters are a handy way to do it. 
<br/><br/>13. USB cables
--- You’ll need both USB A-to-B (the most common USB cables) and USB A-to-mini-B (the kind that’s common with digital cameras) for the projects in this book.
<br/><br/> 
14. Alligator clip test leads(鳄鱼夹测试引线)
---> It’s often hard to juggle the five or six things you have to hold when metering a circuit. Clip leads make this much easier. 
<br/><br/>15. Serial-to-USB converter(串口USB转换器)
---> This converter lets you speak TTL serial from a USB port. Breadboard serial-to-USB modules, like the FT232 modules shown here, are cheaper than the consumer models and easier to use in the projects in this book.
<br/><br/>16. Microcontroller module(微控制器模块)---
> The microcontroller shown here is an Arduino Uno.  See http://arduino.cc/en/ Main/Buy for details about your region.
这里用到的微控制器模块是Arduino Uno，更多可以上官网自己看 <http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Buy>  
<br/><br/>17. Voltage regulator(稳压器)
---> Voltage regulators take a variable input voltage and output a constant (lower) voltage. The two most common you’ll need for these projects are 5V and 3.3V. Be careful when using a regulator that you’ve never used before. Check the data sheet to make sure you have the pin connections correct.
<br/><br/>18. TIP120 Transistor(TIP120 三极管／晶体管)
---> Transistors act as digital switches, allowing you to control a circuit with high current or voltage from one with lower current and voltage. There are many types of transistors, the TIP120 is one used in a few projects in this book. Note that the TIP120 looks just like the voltage regulator next to it. Sometimes electronic components with different functions come in the same physical packages, so you need to check the part number written on the part.

<br/><br/>
19. Prototyping shields(扩展板)
---
> These are add-on boards for the Arduino microcontroller module that have a bare grid of holes to which you can solder. You can build your own circuits on them by soldering, or you can use a tiny breadboard (also shown) to test circuits quickly. These are handy for projects where you need to prototype quickly, as well as a compact form to the electronics. 

20. Solderless breadboard(免焊面包板)
---
> Having a few around can be handy. I like the ones with two long rows on either side so that you can run power and ground on both sides. 

<br/><br/>


21. Spare LEDs for tracing signals(用于跟踪信号的备用发光二极管)
---
> LEDs are to the hardware developer what print statements are to the software developer. They let you see quickly whether there’s voltage between two points, or whether a signal is going through. Keep spares on hand. 

<br/><br/>22. Resistors(电阻)
---> You’ll need resistors of various values for your projects.
<br/><br/>23. Header pins(针脚)---> You’ll use these all the time. It’s handy to have female ones around as well. 
<br/><br/>24. Analog sensors (variable resistors)(可变电阻)
--- > There are countless varieties of variable resistors to measure all kinds of physical properties. They’re the simplest of analog sensors, and they’re very easy to build into test circuits. Flex sensors and force-sensing resistors are handy for testing a circuit or a program.
 <br/><br/>
25. Pushbuttons(按钮)---
> There are two types you’ll find handy: the PCB-mount type, like the ones you find on Wiring and Arduino boards, used here mostly as reset buttons for breadboard projects; and panel-mount types used for interface controls for end users. But you can use just about any type you want.

<br/><br/>
26. Potentiometers（电位器）
---
> You’ll need potentiom- eters to let people adjust settings in your project.

<br/><br/>
27. Ethernet cables(网线)
---
> A couple of these will come in handy.

<br/><br/>
28. Black, red, blue, yellow wire(各色电线)
---
> 22 AWG solid-core hook-up wire is best for making solderless breadboard connec- tions. Get at least three colors, and always use red for voltage and black for ground. A little organization of your wires can go a long way.

29 Capacitors(电容)
---
> You’ll need capacitors of various values for your projects.
